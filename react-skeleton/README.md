# PROJECT TITLE

## Description
- This is a homepage designed using react methods. It employs the use of components to design individual aspects of the webpage as well as CSS styling

The challenges I have faced with this project have been as follows:

1. understanding the use of components and notation of JSX to develop the basics of the homepage

2. understanding how CSS can be employed to refine the basic setup of the homepage. Here I have struggled and am still in the process of working it out. One of the aspects that I am trying to understand and employ in react is the use of CSS grid and/or flexbox in designing the container which houses the images and information.

The other aspect is how to design the main image of the homepage with CSS style. As a novice in programming and web design this leads me to do my own research using google. In particular use of knowledge sites such as youtube, MDN and W3 schools

I hope to achieve at least some of this on the second submission

## How to Use the Project

At present this represents the basics of my webpage but as my knowledge improves on webpage fundamentals I hope to work on improving the webpage further
